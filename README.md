# BasicDeepLearning
This is a repository for my basic deep learning files. It will cover data preprocessing, categorical data processing, 
and basic neural networks.
There will be test files for each section and eventually templates as well.
I hope to do some research in to simple artificial neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks.

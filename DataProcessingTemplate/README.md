 Data Preprocessing
 This file uses the dummy data file Data.csv. The file has 10 records each with 4 fields.
 The first field is the country name which is a category filed and which will need to be encoded.
 The second is the age a numeric field, which has data missing(record 7).
 The third is salary a numeric filed, which again has missing data (record 5)
 The forth is purchased, which is a boolean field and will need encoding as it has categories.
 Using this file we can show how to read data in, how to split the data into data sets, how to handle
 missing data, and how to encode categorical data and create dummy records. We can also show how to feature scale,
 which brings all numeric fields into the same range
